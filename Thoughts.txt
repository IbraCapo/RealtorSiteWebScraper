To search through multiple pages im gonna need to
first off, link is simple
	pages go as link + numPage + "_p/"

can make whole page a while loop as

while numberAfterHyphen > numberAfterOf then:
	run the program and at the end of this while increment +1


after while get contents of houses_collection and put in csv again
at some point include the links

---------------------------------------------------------------------
class of "xx-xx of xxx results" is "Text__TextBase-sc-1cait9d-0-div Text__TextContainerBase-sc-1cait9d-1 RBSGf"
on every page pull out above class to make comparison before moving to next page

ok while loop is gonna need to change link
link increments like this-
[link] + pageNumber + "_p/"
	predefine pageNumber as 1
have everthing run 1 time before the while loop to establish current and total maxes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
should for loop run in while loop? can make for loop a def that is callleeeeeed createMaxes?
oR, don't loop but find pos of min and max and keep it steppin how?
ok split list 0 with "-" get 1 that's current min across every page
max gonna be the same after the first time u find it but it's also the 3rd (index 2) all the time ez

while loop can be-
while current_max != total_max:
	makeCollection(property_cards, houses_collection)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
might have to change to for loop instead while loop being really unpredictable

approach-
find "a" element class = "ButtonBase-sc-14ooajz-0 PaginationButton-sc-1yuoxn6-1 fea-DjF" at index 4
take the text, make it an int, that's the max page ok

gonna have to specify pages numbers manually because program doesn't count the loaded page right
